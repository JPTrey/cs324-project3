 * Coding style:
 * Declare all variables used within the scope of a class/method at the top.
 * Follow indentation patterns.
 * All methods names must be verbs; if it cannot be described, it is performing too many operations.
 * Methods should NOT return any input parameters. Parameters should be final whenever possible.
 * Use setters and getters. Variables/methods should be private/final whenever possible.
 * Use the Output class for console statements. Output.debug calls are ignored whenever Main.debug == false.
 * Pass the least amount of data possible between methods/classes. Avoid passing objects/arrays.
 * Implement Runnable. Do NOT extend Thread.
